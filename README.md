# 2048 Terminal Game with Scoreboard and Redo

This is a terminal-based implementation of the classic game 2048, built with Python and the curses library. Players use arrow keys to swipe and combine tiles, aiming to reach 2048 or higher. The game features a redo system with limited chances (life) and a top 10 leaderboard saved locally in top_list.txt. Each move earns points, and scores are recorded by player name. The colorful board updates dynamically, and players can redo previous moves by pressing R. Press Q to quit and save your score. Fun and minimal â€” play directly from the terminal!
